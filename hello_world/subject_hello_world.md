# Hello World!

In this exercise, you will learn the most basic thing of any language, that is to print `Hello World!`.

### File tree

```
hello_world
├── hello_world.py
└── test_hello_world.py
```

## Instructions 

In the file `hello_world.py`, write a function named `hello_world` that does not take any argument, and displays `Hello World!` on the standard output, with a trailing newline.

To test this behavior, execute the command `python hello_world.py | cat -e` and check that the output of this command is exactly:

```
Hello World!$
```
